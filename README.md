# Bennington Triangle - Vermont's Vanishing Zone

## Overview
**The Bennington Triangle** is a region of southwestern Vermont, centered around Glastenbury Mountain, where a cluster of unexplained disappearances occurred between 1945 and 1950, along with numerous reports of strange phenomena spanning decades. The term was coined by author Joseph A. Citro in 1992, drawing parallels to the Bermuda Triangle. Five people vanished without a trace within this relatively small area during the five-year period, despite extensive searches, and only one body was ever recovered. The region has a dark history including Native American legends warning of cursed ground, a near-ghost town (Glastenbury), reports of strange lights, disembodied voices, and a general sense of unease that persists today.
